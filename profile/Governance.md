# Governance of **spatPomp**

**spatPomp** is a collaborative organization, directed by its core development team. Core developers are as follows:

| Name          | GitHub id  |Start date | End date | Comments        |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Kidus Asfaw   | kidusasfaw | 7/1/18    |          | founding member |
| Ed Ionides    | ionides    | 7/1/18    |          | founding member |
| Aaron King    | kingaa     | 7/1/18    |          | founding member |
| Joonha Park   | joonhap    | 7/1/18    |          | founding member | 

The maintainer was Kidus Asfaw until 8/17/22, at which point Ed Ionides took that position.

We have a few rules, sufficient for a small and friendly organization.

## Rules

1. Decisions are made by a majority vote of the core developers. A simple majority of votes in support of a decision (greater than half the number of members of the core developer team) is required for a decision to be passed.

2. The core developmer team votes to select a maintainer who is responsible for keeping an up-to-date version of spatPomp on CRAN.

3. All core developers can edit the source code without requiring approval from other core developers.  All core developers can incorporate edits proposed by other contributors. No developer should change the edit history, and therefore any change can be reversed if the core development team decides to do so.

4. New core developers are selected by a vote of the existing core developers.

5. Anyone who writes code included in spatPomp is a contributor. A core developer can also add someone to a list of contributors if they have contributed to the project in some other way such as writing open-source applications using panelPomp.
